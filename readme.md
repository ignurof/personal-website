# Personal Website

After a year of learning game development using the Godot Engine and it's proprietary scripting language GDScript I'm now back to creating my own websites.
The first natural step now is to create a personal website that can host all my relevant projects, and perhaps a personal blog.

Starting out for the prototype I'm just developing a raw HTML/CSS/JS site without the use of any frameworks just to get some practice in.
